# Welcome to DigitalCommons Coop 🌍

**Building digital tools for the common good.**

DigitalCommons Coop is a cooperative organisation dedicated to creating open source software that serves the common good. We build tech to power movements for social and ecological justice. We believe in the power of collaboration, shared ownership, and building technology that works for everyone.

- **Democratic Governance** - Every contributor has a voice in our direction
