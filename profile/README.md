# Welcome to DigitalCommons Coop 🌍

**Building digital tools for the common good.**

DigitalCommons Coop is a cooperative organisation dedicated to creating open source software that serves the common good. We build tech to power movements for social and ecological justice. We believe in the power of collaboration, shared ownership, and building technology that works for everyone.

## 🤝 About Us

We're a community of developers, designers, storytellers and organisers working together under cooperative principles. Our projects are built in the open, for the open, with input and contributions from people around the UK.

### Our Values

1. Technology as Tools for Justice: intentionally designed to further the goals of justice, solidarity, and collective liberation.

2. Community-Led Design: movements for social and ecological justice lead; technology follows.

3. Commons over Commodification: open source, shared, and collectively owned; stewarded for the public good.

4. Decentralised Power: technology that is interoperable, transparent, and free from corporate or state control.

5. Solidarity in Action: technology grounded in solidarity, not saviourism. We work with humility, listening deeply and acting in partnership.

6. Resilience and Sustainability: technology that is maintainable, accessible, and adaptive to the changing needs of movements over time.

7. Ethical Innovation: technology guided by values, not markets, and rigorous reflection on ethical implications.

8. Radical Transparency: open processes and shared knowledge, accountable to the communities we serve.

9. Acknowledging Complexity: technology that supports rather than simplifies nuance.

10. Hope and Imagination:  technology that is helping to create the conditions for regeneration, liberation and joy.

Our development process is grounded in collaboration, adaptability, and accountability to social movements. Each phase - Inception, Design, Implementation, Release and Review - is designed to ensure that the technology we create is purposeful, impactful, and aligned with the needs of those we serve.

## Our Approach

At Digital Commons, we build technology that strengthens social movements. Our tools are designed with, not for, the people driving change. 

We work alongside movements at every stage, from understanding their needs to co-designing, developing, and refining the tools that help them organise, share knowledge, and build collective power. Reach out to work with us!

## 🚀 Our Projects

Our core projects are <a href="https://digitalcommons.coop/land-explorer/">Land Explorer</a> and <a href="https://digitalcommons.coop/mykomaps/">MykoMaps</a>.

Land Explorer makes land data open, accessible, and actionable. It’s a free mapping tool that helps communities, campaigners, and cooperatives understand who owns land, plan projects, and build campaigns for change.

Mykomaps makes the work of cooperatives and community organisations visible by helping them connect, collaborate, and drive collective change.
